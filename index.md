### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, is probably one of the hardest labs that I have ever done because
    of the fact that I had so many logic errors and coding errors. With the 
    parking and time and dates that you can park and cant park its 
    complicated for a student like me. But when I finished the project it 
    was rewarding because it is fun to see that my code that is so complex 
    at the time worked and did its job.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was my favorite because of the patterns that was made by 
    loops. Its interesting to me how although it looks simple when ran, it
    is undoubtably hard to code but rewarding in a way where you can see 
    that your code is working as intended in a graphic and visual way. So
    for me this is the most rewarding and most grueling lab I have ever
    done.
    
* Lab 1 

    The start of it all, this is a good lab to look back to, its like 
    looking back at your past self. See how inexperienced you where, where
    you had trouble at, and all the doubts really. When first starting I 
    a lot of doubts on whether or not I will be able to do these labs 
    properly and with ease. And maybe 3 labs later I finally got the hang
    of coding and just translating the commments and learning lingo.
